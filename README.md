# Zebrafish_CRISPR-Cas9_validation_primer_design_helper
## This python program helps designing PCR primers for validation of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA in zebrafish genome. 
## Input: In inputfile.txt, each line contains gene name, chromosome number, genomic coordinates, and two designed sgRNA sequences. 
## Output: the primers_lst.txt file contains the PCR primer sequences and melting temperatures. Also the expected amplicon sequence files are created as well.
